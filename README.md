# MRI-based-brain-tumor-image-detection-using-CNN-based-deep-learning-method
In the domain of medical diagnostics, discriminating brain tumors from healthy tissues in MRI scans poses a significant challenge due to their visual similarities. To tackle this, we propose an innovative solution: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for automating brain tumor detection
